## Introduction

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a system to convert from markdown
files to a range of formats, including html. It is based on [R
Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), but is aimed at a more
general audience, rather than just R users. If you have previously
written files in R Markdown (or [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)),
there is no need to switch to Quarto. You can Quarto files in RStudio
or any text editor.

You will first need to [install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

 If you are starting from scratch, you can follow the [guide
to using Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) to develop your
notes. I suggest using the [Quarto book
format](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) for lecture notes.

If you have existing LaTeX lecture notes, I have written some
instructions below on converting to Quarto (this process is not
entirely straightforward, and is likely to take some time).


## Converting LaTeX notes

1. Create the structure for the notes using [this quick start guide on
   writing a Quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/#quick-start).
   Edit the file _quarto.yml to match the structure of your
   notes. Replace the file "references.bib" with your own .bib file,
   and put the name of your .bib file in the bibliography section of
   _quarto.yml. 
   
   Here is _quarto.yml for the simple example notes:
   
   ```
   project:
	 type: book

   book:
	 title: "Some example Mathematical lecture notes"
	 author: "Dr. A. Lecturer"
	 chapters:
	   - index.qmd
	   - 01-determinant.qmd
	   - 02-variance.qmd
	   - references.qmd

   bibliography: refs.bib

   format:
	 html:
	   theme: cosmo
	 pdf:
	   documentclass: scrreprt
			
	```
	
2. Convert files from .tex to markdown with pandoc. It is possible to
   use [pandoc online](https://pandoc.org/try/). Choose from "latex"
   to "markdown". Copy and paste output into a .qmd file with same
   name as each Chapter's .tex file. The content which you would like
   to appear on the first page when the notes are viewed should appear
   in a file called index.qmd.
   
3. At this stage, you can run quarto to preview the output. If you are
   using RStudio, you can press the "Render" button. From the command
   line, type "quarto render".
   
4. There are likely to be problems with the output. Here are
   problems which needed fixing with the simple example notes:

	a) The default attempt at cross referencing from the pandoc output
		is not correct. Here is the [Quarto documentation on cross
		referencing](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html).
		There is a strict structure for where to put the labels and
		for the names of the labels: for instance, Figures need to
		have labels starting fig-, Tables need to have labels starting
		tbl-. Avoid the use of underscores in labels.
	
		For instance, we include a figure with:
	
		```
		![The caption](figure_filename.png){#fig-test}
		```
		and refer to it with
		
		```
		@fig-test shows...
		```
	
	b) The default conversion of tables does not always work well.
		Try copying the LaTeX table code to pandoc online, then
		convert from "latex" to "markdown-mmd", and replace the
		initial attempt at the markdown table with this one. After
		that, you will still need to fix the label for the table
		(labels for tables should always start with tbl-).
		
		An example table should look something like:
		
		```
		| Column 1      | Column 2  |
		|:--------------|:----------|
		| Hello         | $x^2$     |
		| Goodbye       | $\sin(y)$ |
		
		  : The caption. {#tbl-test}
		```
		
		Which when rendered to html will look like:
		
		| Column 1      | Column 2  |
		|:--------------|:----------|
		| Hello         | $x^2$     |
		| Goodbye       | $\sin(y)$ |
		
		  : The caption. {#tbl-test}
		
		You can cite the table with 
		
		```
		@tbl-test shows...
		```
		which outputs
		
		@tbl-test shows...
		
		Here is the [documentation on tables](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html).
	
	c) The default conversion of AMS theorem-type environments does
		not work well, but it is fairly easy to fix this.
	
		For instance, the theorem in the simple example notes can be
		written as:
	
		```
		::: {#thm-nonneg}
		The variance of any random variable $X$ is non-negative
		$$\operatorname{Var}(X)\geq 0.$$
		:::
		```
	
		Here is the 
		[documentation on theorem environments](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs)

5. Once the preview of the output is looking good, you can try
   creating the html and pdf versions by typing "quarto render" in the
   terminal. 
   
   You may need to fix additional errors at this stage. (With
   the simple example notes, I got an error, which was fixed by
   explicitly stating the file ending of included graphics files.)
   
   Once any errors are fixed, this will make the folder "_book",
   containing the html and pdf notes. You will use this folder if you
   want to [upload to Blackboard](blackboard.qmd). As an alternative
   (if you don't mind your notes being publicly available) it is easy
   to [publish Quarto documents
   online](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/).
