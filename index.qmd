title: "Creating accessible mathematical lecture notes"
---

This is an in-development guide for writing accessible lecture notes
in Mathematical Sciences, which are typically written in LaTeX, and
provided to students in pdf format. This main focus of this guide is
on methods to provide notes in html format.

We consider two systems in detail:

- [Chirun](https://chirun.org.uk/) is a tool to convert LaTeX notes to
a variety of accessible formats. It is a good option if you want to
continue to write your notes in LaTeX. It has a relatively easy-to-use
online interface which means it can be used without installing
anything on your own computer. It is likely that you will need to
simplify your original LaTeX code for Chirun to work. Chirun is under
development and is not yet well documented. Error messages are not
always straightforward to understand.
   
- [quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a system which converts markdown
notes into a wide variety of formats. It is a good option if you are
happy to convert your LaTeX notes into markdown format, then work with
the markdown notes (rather than the original LaTeX source) when you
need to make changes. You can automatically convert LaTeX lecture
notes into markdown format, which can be a helpful starting point, but
the conversion is not perfect and you will need to make changes to get
quarto working. Quarto is well documented. You can include R or python
code easily.
   
Using either system, once notes are converted to html format, we then
want to give students access to them. I have provided some guidance on 
[uploading to blackboard](blackboard.qmd).
