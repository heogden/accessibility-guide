title: "Creating accessible mathematical lecture notes"
---

This is an in-development guide for writing accessible lecture notes
in Mathematical Sciences, which are typically written in LaTeX, and
provided to students in pdf format. This main focus of this guide is
on methods to provide notes in html format.

To demonstrate methods, I will use some [simple example LaTeX
   notes](https://github.com/heogden/simple) (which are based on
   material from Wikipedia). 

I will give instructions on how to use two systems to convert to html
format:

- [Chirun](chirun.qmd) is a good option if you want to continue to
write your notes in LaTeX. It has a relatively easy-to-use online
interface which means it can be used without installing anything on
your own computer. Chirun is is under development and the
[documentation](https://chirun.org.uk/docs/) is currently incomplete.
Here are the [example notes from
Chirun](https://heogden.github.io/simple-chirun). Chirun is
specifically focused on accessibility, and allows users to change the
font, spacing and background colour which may be helpful for dyslexic
students.

- [Quarto](quarto.qmd) is is a good option if you are happy to convert
your LaTeX notes into markdown format, then work with the markdown
notes (rather than the original LaTeX source) from then on. It is
based on R Markdown, but is designed for a wider range of users, and
you can include R or python code easily. Quarto is well
[documented](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/). Here are the [example notes from
Quarto](https://heogden.github.io/simple-quarto).

It is likely that you will need to simplify your original LaTeX code
to get either system to work, for instance reducing dependence on
LaTeX packages. Conversion to Quarto is likely to require more changes
than processing with Chirun.
   
I have also provided some guidance on [uploading html notes to
blackboard](blackboard.qmd).
