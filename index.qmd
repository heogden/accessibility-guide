title: "Creating accessible mathematical lecture notes"
---

This is an in-development guide for writing accessible lecture notes
in Mathematical Sciences, which are typically written in LaTeX, and
provided to students in pdf format. This main focus of this guide is
on methods to provide notes in html format.

To demonstrate methods, I will use some [simple example LaTeX
   notes](https://github.com/heogden/simple) (which are based on
   material from Wikipedia). 

We consider two systems to convert to html format:

- [Chirun](chirun.qmd) is a good option if you want to continue to
write your notes in LaTeX. It has a relatively easy-to-use online
interface which means it can be used without installing anything on
your own computer. Chirun is is under development and is not yet well
documented. Here are the example notes from Chirun. Chirun is specifically focused on accessibility, and allows users to change the font, spacing and background colour which may be helpful for dyslexic students.

- [Quarto](quarto.qmd) is is a good option if you are happy to convert
your LaTeX notes into markdown format, then work with the markdown
notes (rather than the original LaTeX source) from then on. It is
based on R Markdown, but is designed for a wider range of
users, and you can include R or python code easily. Quarto is well documented. Here are the example notes from Quarto.

It is likely that you will need to simplify your original LaTeX code
to get either system to work. Conversion to Quarto is likely to
require more changes than processing with Chirun.
   
I have also provided some guidance on [uploading html notes to
blackboard](blackboard.qmd).
