title: "Uploading to Blackboard"
---


These instructions are for the "original" Blackboard
(rather than "Ultra").

1. Compress the folder containing the html notes to a zip file. For
   Chirun, you can use the zip file downloaded from the Chirun online
   interface directly (e.g. 
   [simple-chirun-main.zip](https://github.com/heogden/simple-chirun/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)). 
   For Quarto, compress the "_notes" folder.

2. Go to your Blackboard course. Under "Course Management", click on
   "Files", then the name of your course. Press "Upload" -> "Upload
   Zip Package", and upload your zip file, which will automatically
   extract the contents of the zip file.  (If unpacking the contents
   of the zip file at the top level of your Blackboard course files
   could create confusion, first press "Create Folder" and make a
   folder specifically for storing your notes)
   
3. When you want to link to your notes (e.g. in Course Content), click
   "Build Content", then either "Item" (to link to multiple documents,
   or write some accompanying text on Blackboard) or "File" (to link
   directly to one document). Click "Browse Course Files", and locate
   "index.html". You will be asked about how to manage access to the
   files in the folder: I suggest "Give users access to this file
   only" (students will still be able to access all files which are
   linked in your notes).  If you chose to create a "File", I suggest
   changing the option "Open in New Window" to "Yes".  Then click
   "Submit".
 
To update your notes on Blackboard after making changes, repeat step 1
to get a new zip file with the updated files. Then repeat step 2 to
upload your new zip file to the course files, selecting the option:
"If selected, the system automatically overwrites the existing file
with the same name".
